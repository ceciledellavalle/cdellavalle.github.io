				<p>I am currently a PhD Student at the MAP5 laboratory and the LjLL laboratory, 
			        which is part of Sorbonne Université, under the direction of Sylvain Durand, Camille Pouchol and Pauline Tan.
				I have three main research interests :
                                inverse problems, neural network denonising and optimisation strategy applied to blind deconvolution.
